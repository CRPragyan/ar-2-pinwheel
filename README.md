# JavaScript AR Pinwheel Project

## Description
This project is a JavaScript-based Augmented Reality (AR) application that generates and displays a colorful pinwheel in a virtual environment. Users can interact with the pinwheel by spinning it and observing its dynamic behavior. The project utilizes AR technology to overlay the pinwheel onto the real world through the user's device camera.

## Features
- Generates a virtual pinwheel in the AR environment.
- Allows users to interact with the pinwheel by spinning it.
- Renders realistic physics-based movement for the pinwheel.
- Provides a visually appealing and immersive AR experience.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: The core programming language used for implementing the AR pinwheel logic.
- **AR.js**: A lightweight library for building AR experiences on the web using JavaScript.
- **Three.js**: A JavaScript 3D library used for rendering the 3D graphics of the pinwheel and the AR scene.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for structuring the web page and styling elements.
- **Device Camera**: Utilized to provide the AR experience by overlaying the pinwheel onto the real world.

## Usage
1. Open the project in a web browser that supports AR.js and has access to the device camera.
2. Allow the browser to access the device camera when prompted.
3. Point the device camera at a flat surface to initialize the AR scene.
4. Once the AR scene is initialized, a pinwheel will appear on the screen.
5. Interact with the pinwheel by tapping or dragging to spin it.
6. Enjoy the dynamic movement of the pinwheel in the augmented reality environment.
